# Hi, I'm Nivekithan 👋

> Backend Engineer at [EPYC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epyc/) | Building distributed systems, compilers, and everything in between

I'm passionate about **backend engineering**, **distributed systems**, and **systems programming**. When I'm not shipping production code, I'm probably implementing a consensus algorithm or building a programming language for fun.

## 💼 Work Experience

**Backend Engineer** @ [EPYC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epyc/) | *Current*

Delivering production systems for clients across scheduling, fintech, and funding platforms. Here's what I've built:

### 📅 Scheduling System

Built a robust appointment booking platform connecting users with industry experts.

**Highlights:**
- 🔒 **Zero double bookings** through proper concurrency control
- 💳 Integrated Razorpay with duplicate payment prevention
- 📆 Google Calendar sync to avoid conflicts
- ⏰ Custom mentor availability management

`TypeScript` `React Router v7` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 💳 Shopify Credits System for Airlines

Enterprise credits management system for airline employee uniform purchases.

**Highlights:**
- 💰 **Balances never go negative** - handled every concurrency edge case
- 🔄 Accurate accounting across refunds, cancellations, and returns
- 🧾 Custom tax software integration for precise sales tax
- 📊 Analytics dashboards for vendors and airline management

`TypeScript` `Next.js` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 🚀 Funding Application Platform

Collaboration platform connecting founders with investors.

**Highlights:**
- 🔄 Application reconciliation across Algolia + multiple internal APIs
- 🛡️ **Fault-tolerant architecture** - graceful degradation when APIs fail
- 🔍 Duplicate detection and missing application recovery

`TypeScript` `React Router v7` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 🎯 Other Wins

- 📨 Built bulk Slack DM system sending **10,000+ messages** with rate limit handling (Bull queue)
- 🏗️ Decomposed monolith → microservices, **slashing memory/CPU usage** during high job loads
- 💰 Developed Stripe payment gateway for events platform
- ☁️ Migrated services Digital Ocean → AWS, improving performance
- ⚡ Created dev environment CLI: **setup time from 2+ days → minutes**
- 📝 Led JS → JSDoc migration: fewer runtime errors, zero delivery slowdown

## 🔨 Featured Projects

*I build things to understand how they work - from consensus algorithms to compilers.*

### 🔍 [Levenshtein Automata](https://github.com/nivekithan/levenshtein-automata)

Fast fuzzy string search using finite automata - **10,727 queries/sec** on 370K-word dictionary.

```
Performance: 38% faster than runtime construction at distance 3
Approach:    Precomputed DFA + Trie-based dictionary
Language:    Kotlin
```

7 implementation versions (v1-v7) showing progressive optimizations from the Schulz & Mihov paper.

### 🗳️ [Go Raft](https://github.com/nivekithan/go-raft)
