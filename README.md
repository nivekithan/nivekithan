### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nivekithan S, I am studying at University of Petroleum Engineering and Studies (UPES) at Dehradun. I am highly passionate about coding and improving my skills on it.

### Previous Work Expreience 

Previously I worked as an Intern in ISRA NGO, I was part of team responsible for maintaning express REST api server which talked with firebase database. I also wrote test for any new features I authored or when I change any features. Working there imporved my understanding of CRUD operations and thus allowed me to create better applciations. 

Once I finished my internship I worked on improving my progamming skils myself, I did that by creating personal projects which you can find below. 

### Resume

You can checkout my resume from the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iW2pn6swLG8FtmXTBvmIM6mW46Jt9EWB/view?usp=sharing)

I mainly focus on web technologies (both frontend and backend), databases (firebase, PostgresSQL).


### Tech Stack

My ideal tech stack for an full stack app would be

- Typescript for static types and better DX
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Reactjs for writing Declarative UI
- Remix an full stack react framework
- PostgresSQL for database
- Express for creating REST API
- Cypress and jest for unit, integration, E2E tests


I am quick and passionate learner, meaning if I have to work on different technology I will not be afraid or uncomfortable with it rather I will think it as learning opportunity and strive to improve myself.

### Projects I am proud of
- [Path finder](https://github.com/nivekithan/path-finder)
- [Texter - A minimal twitter clone](https://github.com/nivekithan/texter)
- [Slate js devtools](https://github.com/nivekithan/slate-devtools)

I have only worked in backend at my previous internship but since its closed source I can't share it here. 

## Path finder

Working site - http://path-finder-brown.vercel.app/


A pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points. This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action, and more!

for more information about this project check out [github repo](https://github.com/nivekithan/path-finder) 

## Texter - A minimal Twitter clone

Working site - http://texter-one.vercel.app/

Its a twitter clone with lot of less features of twitter, I created this project to improve skills in both frontend and backend.

For more information about this project check out [github repo](https://github.com/nivekithan/texter)


## Slate js devtools

npm package - https://www.npmjs.com/package/slate-devtools


`slate-js` is a libary for creating rich editor, I created this `devtools` which can be used with it `slate-js` to ease the debugging of application built with `slate-js`
