# Hi, I'm Nivekithan 👋

> Backend Engineer at [EPYC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epyc/) | Building distributed systems, compilers, and everything in between

I'm passionate about **backend engineering**, **distributed systems**, and **systems programming**. When I'm not shipping production code, I'm probably implementing a consensus algorithm or building a programming language for fun.

## 💼 Work Experience

**Backend Engineer** @ [EPYC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epyc/) | *Current*

Delivering production systems for clients across scheduling, fintech, and funding platforms. Here's what I've built:

### Scheduling System

Built a robust appointment booking platform connecting users with industry experts.

**Highlights:**
- **Zero double bookings** through proper concurrency control
- Integrated Razorpay with duplicate payment prevention
- Google Calendar sync to avoid conflicts
- Custom mentor availability management

`TypeScript` `React Router v7` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 💳 Shopify Credits System for Airlines

Enterprise credits management system for airline employee uniform purchases.

**Highlights:**
- **Balances never go negative** - handled every concurrency edge case
- Accurate accounting across refunds, cancellations, and returns
- Custom tax software integration for precise sales tax
- Analytics dashboards for vendors and airline management

`TypeScript` `Next.js` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 🚀 Funding Application Platform

Collaboration platform connecting founders with investors.

**Highlights:**
- Application reconciliation across Algolia + multiple internal APIs
- **Fault-tolerant architecture** - graceful degradation when APIs fail
- Duplicate detection and missing application recovery

`TypeScript` `React Router v7` `Cloudflare Workers` `PostgreSQL`

### 🎯 Other Wins

- Built bulk Slack DM system sending **10,000+ messages** with rate limit handling (Bull queue)
- Decomposed monolith → microservices, **slashing memory/CPU usage** during high job loads
- Developed Stripe payment gateway for events platform
- Migrated services Digital Ocean → AWS, improving performance
- Created dev environment CLI: **setup time from 2+ days → minutes**
- Led JS → JSDoc migration: fewer runtime errors, zero delivery slowdown

## 🔨 Featured Projects

*I build things to understand how they work - from consensus algorithms to compilers.*

### [Levenshtein Automata](https://github.com/nivekithan/levenshtein-automata)

Fast fuzzy string search using finite automata - **10,727 queries/sec** on 370K-word dictionary.

```
Performance: 38% faster than runtime construction at distance 3
Approach:    Precomputed DFA + Trie-based dictionary
Language:    Kotlin
```

7 implementation versions (v1-v7) showing progressive optimizations from the Schulz & Mihov paper.

### [Go Raft](https://github.com/nivekithan/go-raft)

Raft consensus algorithm implementation with **formal verification** before a single line of code.

```
Verification: P-lang model checking
Approach:     Minimal mutex usage for performance
Language:     Go
```

### [Protohackers Solutions](https://github.com/nivekithan/go-network)

Network programming challenges: TCP/UDP servers, custom protocols, and everything low-level.

**7 Challenges Solved:**
- Custom LRCP protocol (UDP + acks + retransmission)
- Binary TCP protocol for speed cameras
- TCP proxy with address rewriting
- Multi-user chat server
- Asset tracking with binary protocol + SQLite
- And more...

`Go` `TCP/UDP` `Custom Protocols`

### [Tango Programming Language](https://github.com/nivekithan/tango)

Custom language with full compiler pipeline: **Lexer → Parser → AST → Compiler → VM**.

```
Features: Variables, arithmetic, boolean ops, REPL
Output:   Bytecode execution
Language: Go
```

### [Blender Render Farm](https://github.com/nivekithan/blender-render-farm)

Serverless distributed rendering: distribute animation frames across AWS Fargate containers.

```
Architecture: AWS Batch + Lambda + S3
Orchestration: S3 upload events → Lambda triggers
IaC:          Pulumi
```

Parallel rendering with automatic frame consolidation. `Go` `Docker` `AWS`

### [TypeScript Compiler](https://github.com/nivekithan/compiler)

TypeScript → Native code using LLVM. Educational compiler with full test coverage.

```
Supports: Variables, control flow, functions, operators
Backend:  LLVM
Output:   Native code
```
