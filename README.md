### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nivekithan S, I am studying at University of Petroleum Engineering and Studies (UPES) at Dehradun. I am highly passionate about coding and improving my skills on it.

### Resume

You can checkout my resume from the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iW2pn6swLG8FtmXTBvmIM6mW46Jt9EWB/view?usp=sharing)

I mainly focus on web technologies (both frontend and backend), databases (firebase, PostgresSQL).


### Tech Stack

My ideal tech stack for an full stack app would be

- Typescript for static types and better DX
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Reactjs for writing Declarative UI
- Remix an full stack react framework
- PostgresSQL for database
- Express for creating REST API
- Cypress and jest for unit, integration, E2E tests


I am quick and passionate learner, meaning if I have to work on different technology I will not be afraid or uncomfortable with it rather I will think it as learning opportunity and strive to improve myself.

### Projects I am proud of
